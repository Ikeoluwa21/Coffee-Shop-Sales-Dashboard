# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
A Coffee Shop company wants to create a sales report for January through May in 2023 to better understand its customers and increase sales in the coming months.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/Ikeoluwa21/Coffee-Shop-Sales-Dashboard/blob/main/Coffee%20Shop%20Data.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- How many transactions were recorded?
- What is the peak month, day, & hour of transactions?
- What product category do customers prefer?
- What is the total revenue?

- Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://github.com/Ikeoluwa21/Coffee-Shop-Sales-Dashboard/blob/main/Pic%201.jpg">View Dashboard</a>

## Process
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Added new columns to calculate revenue (price * quantity), Month and Day of the week based on transaction date displayed as texts, and hours from the transaction time.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply a slicer of store locations to make it dynamic.

## Project Insight
- A sum of $629,499 was made in revenue with a total of 144,919 transactions.
- Customers prefer Coffee and Tea products compared with other product categories.
- Peak transaction time is 10 am across all shop locations.
- More customers visit the coffee shop on Fridays overall.
- The highest revenue was made in June.
  
## Final Conclusion/Recommendations:
Customers seem to prefer tea and coffee products across all store locations. Therefore, I suggest that marketing be directed toward those products, and that the company make greater investments in them. Peak transaction time occurs at 10 am each day, so scheduling additional baristas during that time will definitely reduce wait times and maintain high service quality. Finally, I propose that further investigation be made into the company's decisions in June, as that was the month with the most revenue, and to see if there is any notable action that can be capitalised on.
